Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is widely known that individuals in a network form declustered communities,
 where each individual can belong to several groups.
 Although another important aspect of these separate/shared communities
 should be encoded via their correlation, as some may induce friendships
 while others inhibit such connections.
 In this paper we account for such co-occurrence via introducing correlations
 among the community memberships of individuals via logistic normal prior.
 We argue that accounting for such correlations both complies with the assortati
ve mixing theory and performs better compared to the widely known mixed-membersh
ip stochastic block model

.
 We furthermore use stochastic variational methods to offer both fast and
 efficient inference.

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ample amount of research has recognized a prevalent feature that networks
 exert meaningful smaller groups
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 These groups namely communities/clusters share the property that within
 group connections among the vertices of the graph are denser compared to
 the between group connections.

 Traditionally the problem of clustering networks included partitioning
 graphs into separate groups
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, whereas more recent works represent the embodiment of more natural processes
 such as shared community memberships
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.Although caution must be taken regarding how one defines communities as
 the concept could vary drammatically depending the context given.
 A common phenomenon observed in many social networks including multilevel
 relationships signifies shared community membershis, hence in this paper
 we define communities as groups of individuals yielding a better understanding
 of the network connections, where individual vertices can belong to multiple
 clusters.
 Many different methods regarding community detection have been developed
 among which address the problem in terms of algorithmic

 or model-based(probabilistic) approach

We employ a model-based approach that allows us to define the network structure
 according to a set of hypotheses in line with the context under study and
 the theory underlying the social formation of friendships.
 We follow the argument of assortative mixing and homophily

 suggesting individuals in a social network tend to communicate with rather
 similar people.
 This phenomenon leads to patterns of structure in networks where we observe
 denser groups of alike individuals that have fewer connections to the rest
 of the network.
 Affinity of individuals and how to measure the likeness among them is condition
al on both context and the availability of information on the individual
 level.Aral et al(2009) employ 20 individual and network characteristics
 as a proxy for similarity between friends where the degree of closeness
 is measured by cosine distance.
 Using a dynamic matched sample estimation, they found further evidence
 that mobile application behavior could be partly be explained by homoophily
 rather than mere social influence

 Another stream of studies defines individual characteristics as latent
 strcutres that need to be estimated from the network data, where potentially
 infinite dimensional individual characteristics are mapped to a lower dimension
al Euclidean space, and the similarity is measured by the distance individual
 locations in this low dimensional space.

Another important type of detectable communities can arise not from the
 densely connected groups but rather dense patterns of connections.Yang et
 al (2014) argues that patterns of connections may also be an indicator
 of different communities when observing denser intra-cluster compared to
 inter-cluster connections.

Many studies have emerged in the field of marketing and management that
 pinpoint the importance of communities underlying social networks in better
 understanding consumer-firm or consumer-consumer relatioships.Ansari et
 al (2011) model a multiplex network of professionals to simultaneously
 study the impact of the organizational interventions on the nature of the
 connections
